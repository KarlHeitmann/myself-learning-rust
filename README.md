# OVERVIEW

This is how I am learning Rust. I saw a video on ThePrimeagen's channel on Rust and Yew, and
the blazingly fast web application one can write using Rust and the framework Yew.

I thought that because I already knew JSX and have a large experience on web apps, it would be fairly easy to
get started with Yew. I was wrong.

I first downloaded the templates available on Yew, I could compile them and run on my computer. Whilst I
was doing a Rust course I found on udemy. After I tinkered a little bit with the templates, I could submit a
PR to the template page to fix a little bug on the update action. To do that, I've saw the other PR that were pending
on the site, and I read a little bit of ELM and how does it's architecture work.

But this teensy-weensy apportation and finishing the Rust course, I felt very stuck. I didn't want to get in the
tutorial hell problem. So I decided to go to codewars and solve the very basic problems available there (level 8kyu)
using Rust, but I didn't want to solve them using the web-editor available on codewars: I wanted to solve them
using my own computer and my local text editor with my local rust compiler.

I built this project to do that. I set-up my local git repo, and then I thought: why not upload this to the internet?
Maybe this can be an example for another people who are eager to know another programming language and don't know
how to start.

This is my method: even thought you may know the basics, return again to the basics adding a new level of difficulty:
solve them using another programming language.

In this repo you will see how I got started with rust, and how I take notes on my files and try many attempts to solve
the basic problems on my own.
